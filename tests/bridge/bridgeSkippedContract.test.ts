/**
 * The bridge SKIP contract — an operation that wrote nothing must never be
 * reported as one that did.
 *
 * The bridge answers a declined write with `{ success: true, skipped: true, reason }`:
 * nothing failed, and nothing changed. Every wrapper read only `success`, so all four
 * skippable operations rendered their success branch — "✅ … added" — over a file the
 * provider never opened, and dropped the bridge's own reason on the way past.
 *
 * What that cost: `add-data-source` on a form-extension was handed three data sources,
 * skipped all three on an over-broad table-match guard (removed in the same change as
 * this test), and replied "3/3 operation(s) applied / ✅ Verified: on disk" over a
 * byte-identical file whose mtime had not moved.
 *
 * Asserted here:
 *  1. skippedMessage() fires on `skipped`, and only on `skipped`;
 *  2. all four skippable wrappers report the skip instead of claiming a write;
 *  3. the word "added" never appears in a skip message — that single word was the lie;
 *  4. the bridge's `reason` survives to the caller;
 *  5. an ordinary write is untouched by any of it.
